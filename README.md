# Library-Management_System
The system allows librarians to enter and update information about books into the system. This includes details such as the book title, author name, price, book ID etc.

The system offers a feature to display all the books stored in the library's database. The system features a user-friendly interface enabling them to search for books based on the author's name, book's name and book's IDs.
